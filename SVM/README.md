## SVM
 
 ---
 ‘Regression’ as a sword capable of slicing and dicing data efficiently, 
 but incapable of dealing with highly complex data. On the contrary, ‘Support Vector Machines’ 
 is like a sharp knife – it works on smaller datasets, but on them, it can be much more stronger 
 and powerful in building models.

----
“Support Vector Machine” (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both 
classification or regression challenges. However,  it is mostly used in classification problems
