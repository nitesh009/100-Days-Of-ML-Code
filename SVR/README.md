## Here I have used a dataset available on UCI repository to predict the relative performance of computer hardware based on some features like

Name of the vendor
Cach memory
Minimum main memory in kilobytes
Maximum main memory in kilobytes
Minimum channels in units
Maximum channels in units and by using this information, we have to predict the relative performance of the hardware.
I have used SVM Regressor for this. There are number of advantages of this model. 
You can read more about this on scikit-learn offical website here

So what are the application of such model. 
Well, lot of hardware manufacturing companies like Nvidia, intel and IBM can use such models to 
compare their hardware with other companies to follow the best design process. 
The data that I have used here is not enough to do that but we can have lot more information from the original creator 
of the hardware.
